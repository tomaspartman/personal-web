# Personal Web

This repository hosts a simple personal website built with plain HTML and images.

## Opening the site

Just open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. You can double-click the
file or serve the directory with any static-file server if you want to test it
locally.

## Customize or contribute

Feel free to edit `index.html` or replace files in the `images/` folder to adjust
the content. Pull requests are welcome for improvements or fixes. Please keep the
site lightweight and static.
